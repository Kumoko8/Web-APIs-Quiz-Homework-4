# Web-APIs-Quiz-Homework-4

# Description

This repository contains the files for challenge 4 homework for week 4 of UT Bootcamp. This project was purposed to expose us to the kinds of quizzes we might encounter in interviews which include multiple choice questions and coding challenges. 
The project is also teaching how to use Javascript to use event listeners, store information locally using local storage, and web APIs. APIs are brought in to browsers to make certain tasks easier and are used by websites often.

# How to Use

This project features a quiz that can test your knowledge of the basics of coding, while tracking your progress, time, and giving feedback ! As you enter responses your time left will deducted with each incorrect answer and your score/high score will be shown after you are finished. By the end you will get an idea of what an interview quiz could be like!
